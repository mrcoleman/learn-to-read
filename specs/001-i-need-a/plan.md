# Implementation Plan: Simple Web Game for Reading

**Branch**: `001-i-need-a` | **Date**: 2025-09-16 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-i-need-a/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
This document outlines the implementation plan for a simple web-based reading game. The game will be built as a static single-page application using TypeScript, webpack, and Bootstrap, without any additional frameworks. The application will be hosted on a simple HTML page.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x
**Primary Dependencies**: webpack, npm, bootstrap, jest
**Storage**: N/A (static web app)
**Testing**: jest (run with webpack)
**Target Platform**: Web Browser
**Project Type**: single
**Performance Goals**: Fast initial load time, smooth animations (60 fps).
**Constraints**: 
- No npm package that is younger than 3 days.
- Use "vanilla" typescript.
- Leverage html when possible.
- Use bootstrap as a css framework.
**Scale/Scope**: Single user application.

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Type Safety First**: PASS. TypeScript's strict mode will be enabled.
- **Consistent Code Style**: PASS. Prettier and ESLint will be configured.
- **Clear Architecture**: PASS. Business logic will be separated from presentation logic.
- **Clean Dependencies**: PASS. Dependencies will be kept to a minimum.

```

### Source Code (repository root)

└── unit/
```

**Structure Decision**: Option 1: Single project.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
Research has been completed and documented in `research.md`.
- Performance goals have been clarified.
- Testing framework has been decided.

**Output**: `research.md` with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

- **Data Model**: The data model has been defined in `data-model.md`.
- **API Contracts**: No API contracts are needed for this static web app. The `contracts` directory is empty.
- **Quickstart**: A quickstart guide has been created in `quickstart.md`.
- **Agent Context**: The agent context has been updated.

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `/contracts/`, `quickstart.md`, agent-specific file.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base.
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (`data-model.md`, `quickstart.md`).
- Each entity in `data-model.md` → model creation task [P].
- Each user story in `spec.md` → integration test task.
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass.
- UI implementation tasks for each screen (Start, Game, Success, Game Over).

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation.
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI.
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files).

**Estimated Output**: 15-20 numbered, ordered tasks in `tasks.md`.

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| N/A       | N/A        | N/A                                 |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [ ] Complexity deviations documented
