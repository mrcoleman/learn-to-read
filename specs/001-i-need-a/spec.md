# Feature Specification: Simple Web Game for Reading

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-need-a`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I need a simple web game that will help my son to read. It should play an audio clip of a word and he should have to type in the word. The words should be simple 2 and 3 letter words. Every time he enters a word correctly, it should play an animation of a super hero hitting a monster. Every time he enters a word wrong, the monster should hit him. After 3 words correct an animation of the super hero defeating the monster should play. After 3 words wrong an animation of the monster defeating the hero should play. As the player types letters, it should display them on the screen. There is a start screen, game play screen, success screen and game over screen. The start screen should have a giant play button and a title of the game. Clicking play should take the player to the game play screen. If the player wins, after the animation is done it should go to the success screen. The success screen shows how many rounds the player has played. The number of rounds played should increase by 1 every time the player gets to the success screen. There should be a button on the success screen for next round. When the next round button is clicked on the success screen, it should go back to t
he gameplay screen and the game should restart. Each round on the gameplay screen should choose a new random set of 6 words. There should be an easy to manage list of words. If the player loses the game on the gameplay screen it should take the player to the game over screen after the lose animation plays. The game over screen should show a title saying "Game Over" the game over screen should have display the number of rounds won. The game over screen should have a button labeled "restart". When the restart button is clicked on the game over screen it should reset the number of rounds played and go back to the gameplay screen."

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a young child learning to read, I want to play a game where I hear a word, type it, and see fun animations, so that I can practice my spelling and reading in an engaging way.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the player is on the start screen, **When** they click the "Play" button, **Then** the game starts and they are taken to the gameplay screen.
2. **Given** the gameplay screen is navigated too **When** the screen is initialilzing **Then** a random set of 6 words is selected from the manageable list of words for the round and the number of correct and incorrect words is set to 0. 
3. **Given** the player is on the gameplay screen, **When** a word audio is played and they type the correct word, **Then** a "hero hits monster" animation plays and their correct word count increases.
4. **Given** the player has answered 3 words correctly, **When** the "hero hits monster" animation for the third correct word finishes, **Then** a "hero defeats monster" animation plays and they are taken to the success screen.
5. **Given** the player is on the success screen, **When** they click the "Next Round" button, **Then** the game restarts with a new set of words on the gameplay screen and the rounds won counter is incremented.
6. **Given** the player is on the gameplay screen, **When** a word audio is played and they type an incorrect word, **Then** a "monster hits hero" animation plays and their incorrect word count increases.
7. **Given** the player has answered 3 words incorrectly, **When** the "monster hits hero" animation for the third incorrect word finishes, **Then** a "monster defeats hero" animation plays and they are taken to the game over screen.
8. **Given** the player is on the game over screen, **When** they click the "Restart" button, **Then** the game restarts from the gameplay screen and the rounds won counter is reset.
9. **Given** the player is typing on the gameplay screen, **When** they enter letters, **Then** the letters are displayed on the screen as they type.
10. **Given** the player types a non-alphabetic character, **When** they enter the character, **Then** no letter should be registereed on the screen or counted towards the word.
11. **Given** The gameplay screen is initializing, **When** the 6 words are selected, **Then** the words should be unique and randomly chosen from the manageable list of words. Words from previous rounds can be selected again.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if the audio fails to play? There should be a button to replay the audio.
- How are the "random" words for each round selected? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the 6 words be unique? Can words from previous rounds reappear?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-005**: The system MUST play a "hero hits monster" animation for each correctly entered word.
- **FR-006**: The system MUST play a "monster hits hero" animation for each incorrectly entered word.
- **FR-007**: After 3 correct words, the system MUST play a "hero defeats monster" animation and transition to the success screen.
